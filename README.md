# Password Trainer

Password Trainer is a GUI to help with learning complex passwords to improve personal security. 

The interface will ask for your initial password, followed by instructions to type another character each time to improve memory.

This project was inspired by a [command line version](https://github.com/kkoomen/password-trainer). This is aimed at those with less technical knowledge or want an easy out-of-the-box solution.
